                            I sit on Earth pondering: why we sometimes hide ourselves from ourselves? Why we sometimes do the opposite and struggle so
                            desperately to find out who we are? Why we have this inborn desire to sacrifice for our moral code, country, religion, children, etc? Why we have this dog
                            eat dog biology? Why we our supported by this fantastic, energetic quantum-vacuum? Why is God hiding? Where have we been in spiritual evolution? Where are
                            we going? And why is love the most motivating force in the world?

                            The Saga of the Mighty Valentine Cosmos and the Tower of Time answers these question through an imaginative, storytelling way. The book starts with stories
                            from distant universes with strange cultures and bodies dwelling in different physical surroundings, then these stories get mirrored forth onto Earth with
                            real people in different times.
                        </p>
                        <p dir="ltr">
                            Forty-nine stories, stories within stories, all tightly wrapped into one story. The stories are told using mirror symmetries, they are told again utilizing
                            the Many Worlds Theory, and finally the stories are combined into one “all-story:” Feynman’s Summation of Histories. Yeah, the story uses quantum concepts
                            for its structure. In the “all-story summation” we find out who we really are! You can believe, but then, it is too outlandish to really believe, even for
                            me. Nevertheless, it is the only way I’ve found for the story to resolve itself. So, I, half believe.
