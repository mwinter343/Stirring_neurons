                <h3> Intro: </h3>
                        <pre>
                                I write books.  I write short stories. Hopefully I'll get off my duff soon and publish some of them.
                            How did I get started?  Even I wonder. I guess I thought I had something to say and it was too boring to
                            tell it normally, so I cheated, and started telling it through fiction. Writers are storytellers so don't
                            ask what part of this is true and what part is fiction. I'm just telling you a story.

                                One beautiful lady said it this way.  "There is no fiction. There is no non-fiction, there is only the
                            real story somewhere, somewhere else but a dream.  But that other place is really no different place at all."
                            She was an expert on these kind of matters, a bar hostess in the slums of Honolulu.  She got to hear stories
                            every night. Of course they were bullshit, but she was so cool.  In tribute, I dedicated one of my novels to
                            her. My three novels are quite different from each other. If they have anything in common, they try to stir
                            up the neurons in your head and place them in unfamiliar places.

                                The first neurons I stirred into unfamiliar places was in my senior English class in high school.  We
                            were assigned to write a three thousand word humorous or children story for our final. Assuming such an
                            effort would prove if we knew sentence structure and punctuation. I cheated. I had written a story about
                            Dick and the Steam Shovel when I was seven, my only experiment in creative writing. So I expanded it.  It
                            just so happened this English class was in 1959, two years after they built a damn dam in Sage Arizona that
                            turned the mighty Colorado River into a wimpy creek. I use to be able to take a kayak down the rapids of the
                            mighty Colorado into the Grand Canyon.  It was a daring, exciting ride with incredible beautiful rock
                            symmetry, Suddenly, with the damn dam, the Colorado River was a wimpy little stream and the nearby Indian
                            reservation in Sage, wow, their food gardens and farms suddenly shriveled up.

                                The teacher handed my short story back and said to me, "Ungradable. Write another story."

                                I didn't. I flunked English and never graduated. End of schooling.

                                That was fifty-nine years ago.  Six years ago my mother died.  She had always told me I needed to be a
                            writer but I laughed it off.  How would she know? Instead I made my profession buying used phonograph
                            records and retailing them here in Hawaii and Arizona.  But in her belongings I found Dick and the Steam
                            Shovel.

                                "That fuckin' English teacher. This is great!"

                                Maybe my mother was right. I should have become a writer. So here I am six years later with three novels
                            and a flock of short stories and no idea what to do with them.  Well, here it is.  The beginning of my
                            writing career, Dick and the Steam Shovel, written when I was seven years old and expanded upon when I was
                            seventeen.
