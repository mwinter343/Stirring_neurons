                    <p>This is my writing.&nbsp; I write books.&nbsp; I write short stories. I write songs. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll get off my duff soon and publish some of them.</p>
                    <p>Writers are storytellers so don&rsquo;t ask what part of this is true and what part is fiction. I&rsquo;m just telling you a story.</p>
                    <p>One beautiful lady said it this way.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is no fiction. There is no non-fiction, there is only the story real somewhere, somewhere else but a dream. But that else place, is really no place different at all.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>She was an expert on these kind of matters, a bar hostess in the slums of Honolulu.&nbsp; She got to hear bar customer stories every night. Of course they were bullshit, but she was so cool.&nbsp; In tribute, I dedicated one of my novels to her.</p>
                    <p>My three novels are quite different from each other. If they have anything in common, they try to stir up the neurons in your head and place them in unfamiliar places.</p>
                    <p>The first neurons I stirred into unfamiliar places was to my English teacher when I was a senior&nbsp;in high school.&nbsp; We were assigned to write a three-thousand-word story for our final.&nbsp;Any kind of story was okay, even a children&rsquo;s story, assuming such an effort would prove if we knew sentence structure and punctuation.</p>
                    <p>I cheated. I had written a Dick and Jane story about Dick and the Steam Shovel when I was seven years old, my only experiment in creative writing. So I expanded it a little. It was about one thousand words and I needed three thousand.</p>
                    <p>It just so happened this English class was in 1959, just two&nbsp;years after they built a damn dam in Page, Arizona that turned the mighty Colorado River into a wimpy creek. Most of the parents of the kids in school worked on that damn dam, and in 1957 there was a party on the streets of Page that lasted a whole week celebrating the completion of that damn dam.</p>
                    <p>I didn&rsquo;t join in on the party. Instead alone, I sat on the banks of a little creek once named the Mighty Colorado River, and drank beer, stewing, while kicking the once moist, now dry, earth, while reminiscing about my trips with a kayak down the rapids of the mighty Colorado into the Grand Canyon. &nbsp;It was a daring, exciting, sometimes life threating ride, with incredible beautiful rock symmetry.</p>
                    <p>Now, suddenly, with the damn dam, the Colorado River was a wimpy little stream and the nearby Indian reservation in Page, wow, their food gardens and farms suddenly shriveled up in the arid Arizona climate.</p>
                    <p>So my Dick, and the Steam Shovel story got extended, as I stared at that giant wall stuffing the life out of mighty Colorado River.</p>
                    <p>That was fifty-nine years ago.&nbsp; Six years ago my mother died.&nbsp; She had always told me I needed to be a writer but I laughed it off.&nbsp; How would she know?&nbsp;&nbsp; But in her belongings I found Dick and the Steam Shovel.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;This is great!&rdquo; I said, reading the handwritten story.</p>
                    <p>So in retrospect, I thought I might share with you my first effort at storytelling, A Dick and Jane story started at seven and extended at seventeen for my senior English final.</p>
                    <p>Push the play button, and the story will begin.</p>
