                    </h4>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Well today is December 1<sup>st</sup>. I&rsquo;m in Kauai with my girl, she&rsquo;s a poet and artist writing a book called &ldquo;She.&rdquo; I had my son who is afraid of actually reading my website, even though he made the website for me, and now I&rsquo;m asking him to post another chapter of my memoir. He&rsquo;s so young. He doesn&rsquo;t know who he is as yet. Even though he is cocky, doesn&rsquo;t know. And I&rsquo;m sure he will take his inspiration for what I don&rsquo;t do. He puts up with me because I&rsquo;m his dad. And we got some of the same genes, so there is a bit of an understanding between us. Well here it is, part three of my &ldquo;memoirs.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;m outside.&nbsp; The rain is lesser now, a normal afternoon soft shower. But where is everybody. I wonder down the street.&nbsp; The roads were crowded earlier, even in the pouring rain.&nbsp;But now they are empty.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;m gingerly walking in the mud, then my right shoe starts going down, down into the mud till my whole thigh is submerged. <em>Quicksand mud. Is there such a thing.</em>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I struggle with my other foot but the mud is too slippery for traction. I fall on my ass, my back soaked in mud up to my neck. Even my hat and my hair are muddy. I lift up to my elbows.&nbsp; In the distance I hear a commotion of voices.&nbsp;a crowd.&nbsp; I get up, caked in mud. I walk on the foot stands of the hooches on the side of the road. No one is complaining. No one is home. Everybody is somewhere. &nbsp;Where?&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>There are these deep ditches in the rice paddies with tall mounds on each side. And the rice paddies don&rsquo;t look like rice paddies now. With the rain weakening, I can see. They look like a lake. And people are bailing water into the deep ditches in a relay, passing buckets of water down the line into the deeper ditches. There is&nbsp;a scream.&nbsp; And people start&nbsp;slushing about, struggling to get to the other side of the field. The scream is a long way away, maybe a football field of water to get to the screams, but a few start swimming, heads lifted out of the water.&nbsp; Why? These rice paddies are fertilized by human shit, shit actually bought from Korean homes in Seoul.</p>
                    <p>But I am the closest to the screams, fifteen yards away from the mud shore of the &ldquo;lake.&rdquo;&nbsp; The stench is always strong, but actually weaker in the heavy rains, enough so, I jump in the paddy and claw my way to the screams.&nbsp; A little girl, maybe ten is holding up two toddlers, the shit water up to her chest. I grab the toddlers and stagger back out of the rice paddy. I leave the toddlers on the muddy road and then see others nearing the little girl. I can&rsquo;t believe they swam that fast, or was it I was slow.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>I look back. People are frantically running to the toddlers. I trudge back into the lake of rice fields.&nbsp; Look around for a floating bucket. There is a dozen or so floating about.&nbsp; I grab one and start lifting water up and over the mound to&nbsp;the ditch and emptying it.&nbsp; Within minutes there is a relay system, as I pass the bucket back and other buckets filled with water are passed to me. All night long, I toss water into the ditch.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>The lake is gone.&nbsp; Crops are showing their heads, now.&nbsp; The rain has stopped. A crowd of people wave me back toward the road.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>My God, I see dawn arising.&nbsp; It must be five a.m.&nbsp; I must have been doing this for ten hours. Suddenly, my strength leaves me. &nbsp;The adrenalin is gone. I can&rsquo;t raise my arms.&nbsp; My legs are weak rubbery-like, too. &nbsp;I&nbsp;can't lift myself fully back on to the road. I laugh at my helplessness.</p>
                    <p>A girl jumps in the water and starts flinging her arms in the water to get to me. She grabs me. She puts my arm over her shoulder. &nbsp;She drags me out of the lake, others helping. She&nbsp;takes me to her hooche. It&rsquo;s a small room with a fifteen square foot back yard, containing a pig, ducks and chickens. She shows me the yard.&nbsp; I can tell she is proud.&nbsp;&nbsp; Probably most of these girls in Koomshi don&rsquo;t have such wealth. She takes off my watery shitty clothes, even my underpants, puts them in buckets. Dries me. Tells me to lay down on her futon, naked. Starts rubbing my legs, then my shoulders. Turns me over. Sees my penis arisen. &nbsp;She says, &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; A warm feeling consumes me. &nbsp;I'm happy, wanted.</p>
                    <p>She gets up, checks the water&nbsp;the clothes are in, hot water created by little furnaces under the floor. The floor is actually hot. &nbsp;I would burn if I was on it naked. She starts scrubbing my clothes in the warm water. &nbsp;I feel&nbsp;relax. My body tingling. Her touch is tough but exquisite. But she seems so business like.&nbsp; She tells me wait.&nbsp; She leaves. She is gone a long time. I&rsquo;m wondering what is happening, me laying on a futon naked, my clothes in hot tubs. She comes back twenty minutes later with a man. Shocked, I reach for a cloth to cover me. There is none nearby. &nbsp;He laughs.</p>
                    <p>He talks proper English.&nbsp; Says, "Give this to your commander.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll be in trouble otherwise.&nbsp; He leaves. She smiles. &ldquo;You can stay now, scoche time.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>She goes back to the tubs, scrubbing them some more and then taking the clothes out and putting them in to a line of rinsing water tubs. &nbsp;Then she squeezes the water out of my clothes. Comes over and starts&nbsp;rubbing me again, this time my front.&nbsp; Her eyes are intense, like they want to burn into you and see your insides.</p>
                    <p>She says, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, relax, she exposes her&nbsp;breasts, then drops her skirt and panties. We make love.&nbsp; My first time. Even to this day I can feel the softness of it. &nbsp;It is tender, loving, gentle, not too passionate but emotional beyond belief. We are both&nbsp;crying after. Then something comes over us and we desperately hold each other. I don&rsquo;t know, maybe twenty minutes, maybe an hour, desperately clinging to each other. It was crazy. I don&rsquo;t know what came over me. I mean I had marks on my back the next day from her desperately holding my back. She, too, probably has marks on her caused by hands.. She was like my life line, after the stuff I refused to pay attention to my first six months in the Army.</p>
                    <p>I guess I was her lifeline, too. We both had probably been through hell and we just started realizing now, how much hell we had been through. I felt I was in a waterfall after a long hot trip in a dessert. My body kept shuddering. I could feel hers shudder, too. We kept clinging, desperately.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back in the barracks I give the letter to my commander.&nbsp; It says I helped with the flood last night and saved two little Korean boys from drowning. Please understand this young soldier was beyond curfew because of a desperate situation.&nbsp; Signed by the Mayer of the Village.&nbsp; (There I go again, making myself a hero).</p>
                    <p>Well, things get better.&nbsp; I get more passes, finishing my work early, and going to Koomshi almost every night.&nbsp; I would, of course, go to her house and&nbsp;to the record shops in town.&nbsp; They sold bootleg American records to the GIs.&nbsp; Koreans couldn't&nbsp;buy them.&nbsp; I think only tea houses were rich enough to have a record machine.</p>
                    <p>Anyway, one day I meet this Korean man in a record store.&nbsp; He introduces himself when I&rsquo;m helping the lady that runs the shop to find a Drifter record.&nbsp; He asked me, &ldquo;What do the GIs like?&rdquo;&nbsp; Of course, I, the greatest retail record genius in the world, went off explaining what this region likes, and that region likes, and what songs to put on compilations, for this type of buyer and that type of buyer.&nbsp; Eventually he invites&nbsp;me to Seoul and I stay&nbsp;with his family on weekends.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>His house is&nbsp;a square with the middle, a rather large open garden.&nbsp; Sliding doors, like you see in Japanese movies, and little fire pots under the floor to keep you warm, the women in one room, even at dinner, the men in another with futons and pillows instead of chairs. It is winter and it is&nbsp;cold, always below freezing in the garden, even at noon.</p>
                    <p>Pak, that is&nbsp;his name, treats&nbsp;me like a king and his family, too.&nbsp; He is&nbsp;going to release a new album from Korean sisters that look&nbsp;like twins, and I meet them in a big park in Seoul in January. How could anybody go to a park in below freezing weather? But there are&nbsp;a lot of people there. I think the English name for the two girls would be Silver Bell Sisters. I could never pronounce their names correctly. It was like &ldquo;UnBongul Jawme, or something.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>Pak wants&nbsp;me to get the record made into a stereo master. So I send&nbsp;it to people in America who could do that kind of thing and it becomes&nbsp;the first stereo record, ever, in Korea.</p>
                    <p>One day, after leaving the park I am&nbsp;taken to a tea shop, obviously, for warmth.&nbsp; I was there with the sister-singers, the arranger, Pak and his family and there is&nbsp;a piano there.&nbsp; They ask if I could play, and of course, the great genius songwriter that I am, I don't&nbsp;take much urging. I play&nbsp;a slew of songs mostly show tunes like, not rock n roll songs like I showed Lou Adler, and they encourage me to keep going. They asks&nbsp;me what they were.&nbsp; I proudly announce, "My own songs." The arranger asks&nbsp;me to play the second one It was the bridge theme from one of my conceertos. I played it again.&nbsp; Then he asked if he could record it with the girls. &nbsp;I say that is only the bridge and I play the whole concerto. I spend&nbsp;the afternoon eating cinnamon toast drinking tea, and playing twelve of my songs which he writes&nbsp;the notes down on a manuscript paper. My name on the records became Wanyah Pak. Wanyah, for my name Winter, and Pak, for Pak's brother who wrote the words.</p>
                    <p>I should mention, I had to be polite, and eat Korean food when I visited them.&nbsp; But the smell alone, could make me barf.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t like Korean food in America.&nbsp; So when I saw cinnamon toast, Oh my God. And when you finish your food in Korea, they always ask if you want more.&nbsp; And I went berserk. They said, "Do you want some more." &nbsp;I couldn't contain myself I said, "Yes.' Over and over again. It was so tasty after eating Korean food all weekend.</p>
                    <p>Just a month later I&rsquo;m in a teahouse in Koomshi listening to Korean music with my all-business lover, and what do I hear?&nbsp; My song with Korean words. It was being played in every tea house I went into, and even some of my songs done instrumental were being played in the teahouses. I was lovin&rsquo; it. Couldn&rsquo;t wait to go to a teahouse and hopefully get a chance to hear my songs.</p>
                    <p>When I got back to Seoul and Pak, he took me to the C&rsquo;est Shibon. It is something you don&rsquo;t have in America, a music hall, where kids go to hear American music, mostly while they do their homework.&nbsp; Very popular, because most kids don't&nbsp;have record machines in those days.&nbsp; In the evenings they have performers and I was invited on stage to play my songs, some of which were familiar to Korean music lovers already.&nbsp; Of course I didn&rsquo;t sing.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a horrible singer and you will never hear my singing voice, even in a karaoke bar. You&rsquo;re safe. Instead they heard my dramatic style, arms flying in the air as I played.</p>
                    <p>Pak kept giving me pure, soft-gold trinket&rsquo;s, rings, necklaces, even a gold bar once and a Kimono for my mother, which I gave all, but one ring, to my love.&nbsp;I wasn&rsquo;t sure it was gold, it was real soft and moldy. Later my girl told me that is what gold is.</p>
                    <p>We use to take walks in the rain, and she would talk in broken English about her business dreams, which included owning a giant rice farm with pigs, cattle, ducks, chicken coups for eggs, and a shrimp pond. But her dreams included much more. She wanted to cure ageing, she wanted a world where every culture shared their ways with every other culture, she wanted to cure poverty, she wanted her farm business as a platform to do much, much more.</p>
                    <p>Other times when the sky was clear at night, and a thousand stars appeared in the sky, we talk about us as being stars who had to come to Earth to help this poor world, but look at us now. And we would laugh. We&rsquo;d wonder what the stars up there thought of us now. Were they upset we weren&rsquo;t doing more? But yeah, we told him, we had plans. Yeah, we talked to the stars on clear nights.</p>
                    <p>And she wanted to marry me and wanted me to stay in Korea. She was convinced she was gonna have a big farm and support me.</p>
                    <p>I&rsquo;d be rich, there was no question in my mind she was gonna make a fortune, and she was pretty damn hard to leave, anyway. But when my year was up, I had to leave at least for a little while. I was being sent to Fort Ord for my last six months in the Army.</p>
                    <p>But leaving was a problem.&nbsp; We were at the airport and she was frantic, holding on to me so tightly, and desperately, I missed the plane. I didn&rsquo;t try too hard either. She might have saved my life that day. When the plane coasted&nbsp;down the runaway, some, probably a&nbsp;North Korean, had a bomb on it, and the tail blew off, six injured, two dead. I went home with my love&nbsp;instead.&nbsp;I was Awol for two weeks, hugging and loving her, before I reported back to AIG to get reassigned on another plane.&nbsp; I thought I was coming back to Korea, and continue my song writing career, and live an easy life with my wife on a giant farm. I figured she was gonna set me up with a record store, too. Never thought otherwise.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>But I didn&rsquo;t know what was coming down when I got out of the Army, six months later.</p>
                    <p>All my life the things I want to do, get sidetracked, somehow by other things. &nbsp;Like putting a light beam on a subatomic particle, and suddenly it is somewhere else. &nbsp;Like me wanting something desperately, then suddenly it disappears.</p>
                    <p>Yeah, that's something else I always wanted to be. A quantum physicist even before most people had ever heard of quantum mechanics. But flunking Algebra 1 in high school stalled&nbsp;that dream. Still I studied quantum theory pretty much all my life struggling to solve problems. &nbsp;Even wrote a novel structured by quantum theory, utilizing mirror symmetry, the many world theory, and finally telling the story through Feynman's summation of histories. That&nbsp;story is called the Saga of the Mighty Valentine Cosmos.&nbsp;And because I couldn't understand regular math, I invented my own type of math that I could understand and began to call it void and mirror mechanics. Well, my experience in Korea did have a massive effect on my writings. &nbsp;You'll see that, especially, when my novel, The Saga of the Mighty Valentine Cosmos, comes out.</p>
                    <p>Guess I&rsquo;m getting sidetracked here. Well in real time, things don&rsquo;t happen in succession anyway. That&rsquo;s an illusion. I think I&rsquo;ll jump forty-eight years now, to four years ago. And one of my thought experiments. Yeah, why not start off the new year 2017 placing our neurons in even stranger places in our skulls. Will post it, next month, January 1, 2017.</p>
