                            The Radio Revolution is the story that turned America upside down and changed it into a real democracy. It does it by evaporating money from the political
                            system through an amendment to the constitution. Only Government funds can be used to pay for all political campaigns. The end of parties. The end of big
                            business lobbies and unfair tax breaks. The end of religious endeavors to change behaviors. It is historic fiction in that it centers on a popular radio
                            station here in Hawaii, Radio Free Hawaii (1991-1997). It is a station I created. And knowing what I know now, this is how it might have really survived
                            beyond seven turbulent years. So I turned it into a fiction account, and showed how it might have blossomed to make America, itself, a real democracy.
