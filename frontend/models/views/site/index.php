                            I write books. I write short stories. Hopefully I’ll get off my duff soon and publish some of them.

                            How did I get started? Even I wonder. I guess I thought I had something to say and it was too boring to tell it normally, so I cheated, and started telling
                            it through fiction.

                            Writers are storytellers so don’t ask what part of this is true and what part is fiction. I’m just telling you a story.

                            One beautiful lady said it this way. “There is no fiction. There is no non-fiction, there is only the story real somewhere, somewhere else but a dream. But
                            that else place is really no place different at all.”

                            She was an expert on these kind of matters, a bar hostess in the slums of Honolulu. She got to hear stories every night. Of course they were bullshit, but
                            she was so cool. In tribute, I dedicated one of my novels to her.

                            My three novels are quite different from each other. If they have anything in common, they try to stir up the neurons in your head and place them in
                            unfamiliar places.
                        </p>

                            The first neurons I stirred into unfamiliar places was in my senior English class in high school. We were assigned to write a three thousand word humorous
                            or children story for our final. Assuming such an effort would prove if we knew sentence structure and punctuation.

                            I cheated. I had written a story about Dick and the Steam Shovel when I was seven, my only experiment in creative writing. So I expanded it. It just so
                            happened this English class was in 1959, two years after they built a damn dam in Sage Arizona that turned the mighty Colorado River into a wimpy creek.

                        <p dir="ltr">
                            I use to be able to take a kayak down the rapids of the mighty Colorado into the Grand Canyon. It was a daring, exciting ride with incredible beautiful
                            rock symmetry, Suddenly, with the damn dam, the Colorado River was a wimpy little stream and the nearby Indian reservation in Sage, wow, their food gardens
                            and farms suddenly shriveled up.

                            The teacher handed my short story back and said to me, “Ungradable. Write another story.”
                        </p>
                        <p dir="ltr">
                            I didn’t. I flunked English and never graduated. End of schooling.

                            That was fifty-nine years ago. Six years ago my mother died. She had always told me I needed to be a writer but I laughed it off. How would she know?
                            Instead I made my profession buying used phonograph records and retailing them here in Hawaii and Arizona. But in her belongings I found Dick and the Steam
                            Shovel.

                            “That fuckin’ English teacher. This is great!”

                        <p dir="ltr">
                            Maybe my mother was right. I should have become a writer. So here I am six years later with three novels and a flock of short stories and no idea what to
                            do with them.

                            Well, here it is. The beginning of my writing career, Dick and the Steam Shovel, written when I was seven years old and expanded upon when I was seventeen.
