                            It is humor/science-fiction, but a with heavy economic message. There is this Mexican scientist who wants to destroy the world of the gringo. How? He
                            creates the mass duplicator capable of duplicating any material thing from water, to gold bars, to collectables to fancy cars, by using free energy from
                            the quantum foam and applying his mirror mechanics to objects.

                            He is a bit fat, talks slow, pronouncing individual syllables at times, makes sign slogans on ply-board and hammers them on to walls and ceiling of his
                            house and with such vengeance the plaster breaks. Still he proves to be the outlaw that brings down the gringo power structure and thus is forced to hide
                            out on a little island in the Pacific Ocean.

                            There he continues his obsession of making slogans on posters building his museum and placing his life story on 1400 sign posts in the Norfolk Pine forest
                            of Kauaâ€™i. This book is a collection of those sign posts
