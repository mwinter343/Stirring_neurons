                        <p>RECOLLECTION TWO&nbsp;&nbsp; ARMY DAYS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                    </h4>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay so much for my books. More memoir time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>I just turned twenty-one, the day Kennedy got assassinated. I was at Jesse&rsquo;s Texaco Gas Station forty miles north of Mohave City in a cool 109 temperature day. A staunch Republican it was sad to hear about the communist killing a President, but oh well. Nixon had another chance. Then one hour later I get my draft notice. I am to join the army.</p>
                    <p>My dream of selling 45rpm records for a living in between the grease cans and bathroom at Jesse&rsquo;s Texaco gas station had come to a crushing blow. I was to become a buck private with a rifle as they flung my body into the jungles of Viet Nam. I would just have to wait for them to assemble my body parts and send them back home in a gunny sack.</p>
                    <p>To understand the magnitude of my job loss, I should go back to me at thirteen years old. I had a dexterity problem and my Grandmother thought the only solution was teaching me the piano. She was a concert pianist, played in the Indianapolis Symphony as the lead piano and played with Hoagy Carmichael. She was there when he wrote, &ldquo;Star Dust,&rdquo; then far more jazzy and uptempo.</p>
                    <p>I heard that story a thousand times, and she took a harsh stick to my hands when I butchered the classics. I had a tendency to pound them, I thought I was a reincarnation of Wagner, hands flying in the air as I pounded. I was dramatic and loud as hell. Even on the Moonlight Sonata.</p>
                    <p>So there was only one way out. I had to write my own music. She couldn&rsquo;t complain that I was butchering my own music, could she? Well she could go into a huff and go to her bedroom and slam the door, but that didn&rsquo;t hurt my hands.</p>
                    <p>So I became a piano concerto composer, I thought I was the reincarnation of Gershwin, and a song writer and obsessed with pop music, using every cent I had to buy one-dollar rock n roll 45 rpm records. Those were those little records, expensive for those days. Then I would go to other kids houses and negotiate buying there old 45s for twenty-five cents. And somewhere along the way I got an ear for what would be hit, before it became a hit, and I would go to all the record stores and tell them what to buy, and of course I was always right. But somehow my great expertise never earned me a job in a record store. I was looked upon, possibly, as a real arrogant asshole, who knew everything they were doing wrong and made a point of telling them that.</p>
                    <p>So at age twenty, when a guy had a losing record store in the upper Mohave Dessert I was more than thrilled he was desperate enough, to hire me, anyway. It was a one man show, Jay&rsquo;s Record Bin, in between the grease cans and the bathroom at Jesse&rsquo;s Texaco Gas Station. I even slept in the dessert at night tell I got housing, but I was on my way to stardom, I felt it.</p>
                    <p>First day, out of school, a mob of teenagers invaded the store and kept me from seeing who was stealing. When they left there were a few empty record bins.</p>
                    <p>Second day I put the 45s behind the counter and blasted Arabic music over the speakers when the kids came out of school, the crowd winced and left, even before entering.</p>
                    <p>Third day I hauled all the dead stock down to the distributors and traded it for what the store really needed. I exchanged mostly albums, for 45s and decided to make my niche singles and classical records, screw the easy listening vinyl long playing records that were so innocuous, no one with an ear could possibly buy them.</p>
                    <p>I carried a wealth of old 45s and the key classical recordings worth gracing a space in the Mohave desert. I brought in the new hot singles, stocked him well, and people would travel 120 miles to buy stuff from me &lsquo;cause I had what nobody else had. I was on it.&nbsp;&nbsp; And classical fanatics begin to find my store, come and talk their intellectual shit, and I would play into their hands and they would end up buying every classical record I recommended. Business went up tenfold, which wasn&rsquo;t sayin&rsquo; too much, cause sales before averaged fifty dollars a day. My boss was ecstatic. Even gave me a raise three times in the first four months. And I became the first, probably in the entire country, to buy used vinyl records. I bought old singles for six cents, and sold them for twenty-five cents and classical LPs for fifty cents and sold only quality-talented conductors and composers used records, for two dollars each.</p>
                    <p>I was ready to explode, take over the entire market with one chain after another, let all the idiots who wouldn&rsquo;t hire me, feel my wrath. Then Kennedy gets shot. One hour later I get the letter. You&rsquo;re drafted. Report December 24<sup>th</sup>, 1963 for your physical.</p>
                    <p>The world would never know the great retail record genius. In desperation I thought I had just enough time to sell my songs, and got a band recording my songs, and I went to Lou Adler, a kingpin in the record industry, and he liked the songs.</p>
                    <p>But as I was taking a plane to Fort Polk, Louisiana for basic training, the band broke up, and never showed up for the audition. And the great song writer that I would have become with all the great music in my head, would instead have that great musical head blown apart in the jungles of Viet Nam. So I thought.</p>
                    <p>I told you I had a dexterity problem. Concert piano didn&rsquo;t help. And dexterity problems and the army don&rsquo;t mix. The army takes personal offense to guys that can&rsquo;t learn how to disassemble and reassemble a rifle. My sergeant was more than pissed. He thought I was trying to get out of the infantry.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a genius,&rdquo; I told him, But I can&rsquo;t tie my boot shoelaces, much less unravel and put together a rifle. And by ten o&rsquo;clock that night I was laughing out of sheer tiredness, but of course the sergeant considered shooting me right then there. &ldquo;Why bother, waiting,&rdquo; he told me, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be dead the first day in the action anyway.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>It was one thirty in the morning, seven and half hours after everybody had figured out how to do it, that I finally got it. My locker, six and half feet tall, filled with my army stuff was transported to the supply room by yours truly, and I was forced to wait until six am. at attention, when the supply room was opened, in order to deposit it. That sergeant sat there, stared at me that whole night. Didn&rsquo;t sleep, just stared. Determined to keep me at attention the whole night. He said, &ldquo;After breakfast, if the captain doesn&rsquo;t decide to shoot you, you can haul your foot locker back up the three flights of stairs.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>I went to reverie late, got an Article 15 for being tardy, stood at attention another ten minutes before being dismissed for breakfast. I don&rsquo;t remember eating. I just slept. Next morning, I couldn&rsquo;t get out of bed, I was so stiff. The Captain came to the room with a doctor, got appraised I needed to get in motion or it would get worse, and I was lifted out of bed in excruciating pain, shoved with brisk hands to the floor, then being yanked up, and walking painfully down the three flights of stairs. It must have taken me twenty minutes to get to the ground floor, despite the shoving of the sergeant. Then I little stepped to the kitchen and washed dishes for lunch and dinner that day, too afraid to leave my feet, afraid if I sat down I couldn&rsquo;t get back up.</p>
                    <p>I don&rsquo;t know what was with wrong me. I just kept smiling. I just didn&rsquo;t pay attention to what now I might call abuse.</p>
                    <p>The next day I was still incredibly sore but it was grenade practice. I told them I don&rsquo;t think I could throw it with the tightness of my arm. They insisted. I tried to throw it, but my arm wouldn&rsquo;t obey and the grenade landed just above the dugout. The instructor threw his body over me, and I had a hum in my ears for a decade. He tried to save my life and all, throwing his body over mine to shield me from the grenade, me an expected to be a worthless causality the first day in combat. He didn&rsquo;t even get mad. He was cool. I&rsquo;m sure he would or had held his ground in combat. I figured if I was gonna die the first day in combat, I&rsquo;m somehow, might find a way to save another life in the process. That guy inspired me.</p>
                    <p>After basic and advance infantry training, everybody gets a two-week leave. But I didn&rsquo;t. Mostly due to uncontrollable laughter when sergeants get so serious over nothing. I got no passes and on the last day I was held over three days as punishment and asked to write a 5,000-word essay on why I laughed.</p>
                    <p>. A Philosopher at heart, they had no idea how serious I would take the project. I delved into laughter, its reasons with such depth, I wrote 20,000 thousand words. And scores of rewrites. I wish I had what I wrote today. But I handed it over to the sergeant and he and the commission officers decided I was making a spoof of the army and acting stupid deliberately. They didn&rsquo;t understand my dexterity problem. I was detained two weeks that I was supposed to be on leave. I was kept on base because of insubordination. They even tried to say I was still on leave while in prison in the barracks. But the AIG a year and half later overruled it and I got my back pay for the time I was claimed to be on leave.</p>
                    <p>After advance infantry training, I was flown to San Francisco for the boat to Viet Nam. I prepared my mind for the landing and then instant death. No questions in my mind. I would land I would die. My great songs would never make it to Earth. My record retail dynasty would never be. Odd, but it made me laugh. What else can you do when you see the hopelessness of the situation. It is like you are in a dream. You are not there, anyway. You are somewhere else when death is near. I&rsquo;ll never forget that feeling.</p>
                    <p>On the boat everybody knew where we were going though no one in charge said. We gambled whatever money we had not thinking we would need it when we landed. I was the big winner, but someone told the officer I was cheating and he took all of my money. It was simple black jack. No way to cheat with six people playing. But the officer took all my money and further he was in rage when he saw I had a giant tear in my fatigues. He grounded me from going on pass when we landed in the Philippians. So, still, I never had, in my twenty weeks in the Army, a pass, much less a leave. And I would die before I ever got one. I knew that.</p>
                    <p>There would be survivors some said. &ldquo;We all can&rsquo;t die.&rdquo; But I knew I would be the first.</p>
                    <p>I learned this later but maybe God had a hand in thwarting my demise. That&rsquo;s a terrible thought. Would God take off heads of North Koreans so I could live? I&rsquo;m not especially religious, but damn, magic happened. Not to a few North Koreans. But to our boat.</p>
                    <p>The Korean DMZ had lots of countries controlling the borders and one of them was the Turks. They had this interest in teasing North Koreans with the heads of their soldiers. They would sneak over the border, chop off a head, come back the next night and wave it to the North Korean centuries on a stick, and guns and artillery would fire, and North Koreans would come out in a full assault and kill some of the Turks carrying the heads. War looked eminent. Because of this, our boat, I believe, was redirected to the DMZ of Korea.</p>
                    <p>I&rsquo;m thinking this because we were headed off a few days from the Philippians, and suddenly the boat spun around and went the opposite direction. That landed us in Korea in six days.</p>
                    <p>You have been on the boat for near a month, totally lounging, nothing else you can do. You get off the boat, you still have sea legs and you take the hour travel to the DMZ in a flatbed truck like cattle, with no room to even sit down, you get jostled back and forth on dirt roads and the battalion commander tells you don&rsquo;t bother checking into your barracks, go to the supply room and get your rifles.</p>
                    <p>You put your duffle bags in a heap outside of the supply room, and you are suddenly demanded to run up a bayonet assault course on a mountain in the muggy heat of the Korean Summer. Some guys plunged into the creek they were supposed to leap over and there is a sergeant telling them, &ldquo;Get back up and jump it again.</p>
                    <p>I managed to make the leap but then I shouted. &ldquo;Are you mad, they still got their sea legs. If they didn&rsquo;t do it the first time, no chance they&rsquo;ll be able to do it again.&rdquo; I looked at him. He looked at me. &ldquo;Soldier get back on the bayonet assault course.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>I knew he heard me. And I&rsquo;m proud he blew the whistle three minutes later. It was over. My first victory in the Military. I don&rsquo;t know. Maybe he would have done it anyway, but it was good thinking my yelling helped. You know, now that I think about it, it did help, otherwise I would have been punished.</p>
                    <p>Every night my duty was to stand guard over the DMZ&nbsp;&nbsp; Shoot the North Koreans who were trying to reciprocate and take off our heads, like the Turks did to them. There was gunfire pretty much every night, and dead North Koreans, though I wasn&rsquo;t aware of any US causalities. I was blessed with 20/8 vision, even asked if I wanted to be a sniper after I had, to my shock, excelled at marksmanship in advance infantry training. It meant being force to reenlist and extend my time in the Army and going for more training in some remote part of the South. To that idea, I ran to the Chaplin and asked for conscientious objector status. Didn&rsquo;t get out of the Army but I didn&rsquo;t become a sniper. So I remained back in my 111 MOS, with no ASIP (Additional Skills Identifier Potential, attached, or more properly named, cannon fodder for the Viet Cong.</p>
                    <p>Our guard posts were fifty yards apart. We were told to shoot to kill. One night, with my special eye sight, I saw shadows in the distance. I figured I could shoot them, even a hundred yards in the distance, but I wasn&rsquo;t sure what they were. They could be some sort of animals. Couldn&rsquo;t tell. There wasn&rsquo;t much cover, there were bushes sparsely separated and they seemed to be sneaking closer. Night vision is weird. I don&rsquo;t know where it comes from but you can see a flash of light for an instance, and then it returns to shadows. In a flash of light I saw them. Koreans are smaller normally, but these two were obviously kids. Maybe twelve years old. And one was probably a girl. Nor did I see rifles.</p>
                    <p>I yelled, &ldquo;Ka Se yo&rdquo;. They froze. I yelled it again. It was about the only Korean words I knew. &ldquo;Go&rdquo; They just stilled. Maybe three, maybe ten minutes. I was patient. I waited. Then they started moving closer. Damn it, I thought.</p>
                    <p>I knew I could scare the shit out of them. I did. I left my post ran down the hill screaming like I was trying to block a punt and screaming to shake up the punter as I approached to block it. I had blocked five punts in high school football. They ran. They just had long knives almost sword length. I don&rsquo;t know what happened to me. I just kept running after them. I was fast, I gained ground, then the girl fell. I stopped. Saw her friend lift her up and then they started running away again. And I turned around and walk back, didn&rsquo;t even look behind me. I could hear them treading the ground and still fleeing.</p>
                    <p>Other posts heard my screaming. They started firing their guns at nothing. I calmly walked back. When I reached my post a sergeant was facing me. &ldquo;You are court martialed, son. You left your post. You want to kill all the guards out here tonight. If they got behind our post, we would be butchered.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>I didn&rsquo;t say a word. I was so in rage at the North Koreans sending little kids, I couldn&rsquo;t speak.</p>
                    <p>Being a PFC 1, they couldn&rsquo;t bust me any farther, so I ended doing KP duty for two weeks. And they changed the court martial to an Article 15. Article 15 means if you do it again you end up in the brig for six months.</p>
                    <p>I never saw myself as a felon, but I could see it coming to that.</p>
                    <p>But luck was with me.</p>
                    <p>Our battalion Commander liked war. His dream was to go to Viet Nam. He only wanted infantry MOS in his battalion. That MOS was 111. So if you had a clerical MOS like 711, you were ejected from his battalion. But he got in trouble with the AIG, because his status reports, (who was in his battalion and who wasn&rsquo;t were all screwed up), and he didn&rsquo;t have a clerk typist who could type a proper court martial, and he had five or six court martials every week. He didn&rsquo;t care. He just wanted war.</p>
                    <p>But AIG cared, in fact his job was in jeopardy. So one morning at reverie the Captain asked if there were any typist in the company. I raised my hand instantly. I couldn&rsquo;t type, but I had to get out of this infantry shit. That night I went to the orderly room, got a typing book, and practiced and practiced. Fell asleep in the orderly room around four AM, and ousted for reverie at 6AM. Went to work for A company that day. I was pretty bad, and I had to learn these elaborate Morning Report procedures but they had no one else, so they had to put up with me. And I learned it well, and two weeks later I was sent to headquarters company, and a month later I was doing the morning reports for A.B.C and head quarter&rsquo;s companies every day. We were supposed to have a clerk for each company, but I did all four. And the endless court martials that took seven carbon copies and where you couldn&rsquo;t even have a white out on one. I did them, and fast. Rarely made a typo. I would get to work at 5AM and go to bed at eleven pm or midnight, every day of the week. Never got a pass. But I was happy. I was needed, and the Captain really appreciated me. When inspections came and the Battalion commander inspected personally, the Captain actually prepared my bunk for inspection, so I could keep fixing five years of back paperwork that was all screwed up, and that the AIG was demanding corrected for all four companies.</p>
                    <p>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>So the company commander job was in a sling. The AIG was on his ass. But he couldn&rsquo;t see that. Even though he had a one-week-ultimatum, to get five years of morning reports in order, he sent everybody, me included, on maneuvers inside the DMZ itself! The Captain was the driver, the Battalion Commander was the passenger, and I was in the truck bed typing the corrections of five years of morning reports to save his ass while the truck bounced around on the dirt sage brush, flinging dust into the bed of the truck.</p>
                    <p>I was wondering when the North Korean artillery would start shelling us, we being in the demilitarize zone.</p>
                    <p>Fortunately, there was another distraction. Our truck ran over an anti-personnel mine and the back tire on the truck blew. The Battalion commander jumped out of the truck, while I waited for another personnel mine to blow him to bits. (We were told in advance infantry training that mines were grouped in threes and fives), But all he did was prance, not looking at the ground, to the back of the truck. He yelled, &ldquo;Winter, change the tire.&rdquo; I almost was hoping he stepped on a mine and save me from the same fate as I raised my feeble salute, &ldquo;Gary Owen, Sir.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s what we are forced to say in the 7<sup>th</sup> Cavalry every time we salute an officer. We never asked why. You don&rsquo;t ask &ldquo;why&rdquo; in the army. But the scuttlebutt was Gary Owen was the only survivor of Custer&rsquo;s Last Stand. Probably played possum with his head deep in a gopher whole to discourage scalping. Yeah the Army is into tradition. I mean we are still called the 7<sup>th</sup> Cavalry, even though we haven&rsquo;t seen a horse for near a hundred years.</p>
                    <p>The battalion commander of course gave a sharp salute back, as his face went red with my response.&nbsp;&nbsp; I hesitated. &ldquo;Sir, you need air support. Your feet are on deadly dirt. Look carefully, and get back in the cab.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;Fix the tire or you are in the brigade.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>Thinking brig was better than death, I said, &ldquo;Sorry sir, company clerks have no idea how to change tires, especially with the axel, violated. We need a helicopter to take us out of this danger zone, now.</p>
                    <p>I wasn&rsquo;t right. The captain laughed at my suggestion later.</p>
                    <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in the brigade for the rest of your tour, Winter.&rdquo; The Battalion Commander did an about face and went back in the truck, He called for a bomb detail and canceled the maneuver. Another truck came by and I leaped into it, lugging my typewriter and papers with me, and went back to the base.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the battalion got back three days later. The Battalion Commander still continued maneuvers but not in the DMZ, I had fixed five years of status reports with all the corrections in sixty hours with only cat naps between.</p>
                    <p>When the Captain got back he commended me for fixing five years of morning reports for four companies in five days. &ldquo;Winter, you deserve a leave, don&rsquo;t worry about the brig, but I can only give you a one-day pass. Go for it today and tonight.&rdquo;</p>
                    <p>We had survived the AIG scrutiny. There was a full change in our manpower of seventy-one people because of the previous mistakes on the morning reports that had compounded through the years. In other words, because of court martials, ejections, transfers, deaths, leaves, adding/subtraction mistakes and medical departures, we had seventy-one less soldiers than the old morning reports indicated. It gave us less food and supplies, but it saved the Battalion Commander&rsquo;s ass. Our battalion commander didn&rsquo;t thank me, but he didn&rsquo;t pay attention to me anymore, either. Before he had been on my ass for not having a sharper salute, my attire, and my inability to do inspections properly. I couldn&rsquo;t even make my bunk to army standards. Whew, I had a reprieve.</p>
                    <p>And I was excited. I had a one-day pass. I could go out and find out what Korea was really like. I had been in the Army six months, and never had a pass or even a leave until this morning. And it was raining buckets, but I didn&rsquo;t care, I had even lost my trench/rain coat, so I was just soaked in an instant. I didn&rsquo;t care.</p>
                    <p>I found a teahouse in a little border town called Koomshi. Listened to Korean music and sipped tea. Loved the experience. The roads were all dirt, and I had mud up to my knees on my trousers. No one talked to me, I was the only GI there. And I don&rsquo;t think anyone could talk in English, so I just listened to Korean. They talk so excitedly, you would think they were having an argument but then they hug each other as friends, and I was bit confused, but liking the experience. And I loved the Korean music. I was in heaven. My first day in a foreign country. But I stayed inside. I really didn&rsquo;t feel like going out in the pouring rain. It was raining so hard you couldn&rsquo;t see much anyway. It was non-stop, pounding on the thatch roof of the teahouse all day. I just kept drinking more and more tea. Then two men rushed in the tea house and everybody started talking even more excitedly, and suddenly they all stormed to the door in the pouring rain. I was the only one left. Even the waitresses left. I was curious. After about five minutes I followed.</p>
                    <p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m gonna take a break now as I walk out into a softer rain and see where everybody is going. I&rsquo;ll talk about it next month, December 1, 2016.</p>
