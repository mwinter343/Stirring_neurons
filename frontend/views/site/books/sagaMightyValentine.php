                        <p>SAGA OF THE MIGHTY VALENTINE COSMOS AND THE<br />TOWER OF TIME</p>
                        <p>DUE OUT IN JUNE OF 2018<br />SAMPLE...INTRODUCTION AND FIRST CHAPTER</p>
                        <p>Going deep into the fabric of our Cosmos, beyond the molecules, beyond the atoms,<br />beyond the subatomic particles, are seven "throbbings"; (living beings), that dwell in innerspace<br />and juggle space-time. So Danny Heinzwaffle believes. He has even labeled them:<br />1) "SYM"<br />2) "D" <br />3) the "Writer"<br />4) the "Princess"</p>
                        <p>5) the "Fisherman"<br />6) the "Clown"<br />7) the "Judge"<br />These seven throbbings operate in a virtual world, meaning they come and disappear<br />before they can be captured in space-time. Yet Danny believes they stir the twenty-two<br />dimensions of space-time as well as imaginary space-unaware time, and in such a way , they<br />create earthquakes and avalanches in space-time. and some of these beings, actually, in<br />desperation, appear in space-time. Yes, to Danny, the Cosmos is alive and these key characters<br />replay its stories over and over through space-time, struggling to find better solutions as well as<br />a better endings, while risking destruction with every replay. Danny says, "It us who play out<br />their stories in space-time. Could it be? Our worlds could be affected by these inner beings?<br />Danny says, "Do not be skewed by what you see. Something far greater and far more scariar<br />is at play."<br />I'm Willy. I don't know. It is just too fantastic to believe. Other beings trying to create beauty<br />and peace, through enormous obstacles, and failing miserably.I can certainly see the failing part.<br />While at the same time threating the destruction of the entire Cosmos with each new attempt to<br />create beauty and peace? But listening to Danny's story, I'll admit, it makes you wonder. Is Danny<br />crazy, as most of the world thinks, or could this really be what is happening in our Cosmos.<br />Listen, decide for yourself? It does makes more sense to me than the other religious stuff I hear.</p>
                        <p>BOOK ONE<br />IN THE SOUND OF THE FISHERMAN<br />CHAPTER ONE</p>
                        <p>March 28, 1980<br />A lone desk littered with old Coke bottles, some filled with ashes and cigarette<br />butts, stood in the middle of the office. The door was open.<br />This a psychiatrist office? Danny wondered.<br />He looked around. The doctor wasn't there. No one was there. He told himself to<br />be careful. He was in trouble, not in a good state of mind for meeting a psychiatrist who<br />could put him back in the mental hospital. He was a Rip Van Winkle who had awakened<br />to this world after three months of totally losing his memory. From December 31, 1979 to<br />March 21, 1980, he had just evaporated. No receipts. No traces of any kind. It was like<br />he suddenly materialized, as if he had leaped time almost three full months.<br />But he also knew it was unwise to avoid his psychiatrist any longer. He could fake<br />it. She doesn't have to know he lost his memory of her.<br />Dr. Lei burst in the door like a firefighter, made five or six excuses why she was<br />late and told him to sit down on the lone auditorium chair while she got his file.</p>
                        <p>She looked like a forty-year- old school girl from the 1920s whose forte was the<br />Charleston, while her large silver dollar bifocals, made her look like an over-sexed<br />librarian. He had always suspected that psychiatrists were crazier than their patients.<br />&ldquo;I'm just moving in.&rdquo; It was like the sixth apology in three minutes. If he knew<br />this lady, he couldn't remember. That is not good, he thought. He should be able to<br />remember the doctor he had seen many times in the last three months while supposedly<br />being in the mental hospital.<br />&ldquo;Sorry, I'm late, too,&rdquo; he said.<br />Her aura of chaos was a bit enchanting, and she was sexually alluring with her<br />slender body, sapphire eyes enlarged by her bifocals, a miniskirt revealing pretty legs and<br />a charming laugh that made him feel immediately comfortable.<br />She looked up from behind a heap of papers, her spiral curls randomly falling on<br />her forehead, as her eyes turned to look directly at him. He knew she was sizing him up.<br />He was cool. He just smiled.<br />&ldquo;Danny, don't let me scare you, but I want you to remember you are under state<br />care, and if you don't cooperate, no matter what I advise, the state will put you back in<br />the hospital. I called you nine times. I went to that silly lobby at the YMCA and they told<br />me women are not allowed upstairs. Not even doctors! I guess I don't look like a<br />psychiatrist. When I leave a message, you got to get a hold of me as soon as possible;<br />None of this six days before you respond. You should know this. The state wants you<br />back in the hospital. They get money from the federal government for you staying there,<br />which justifies the abnormal amount of help they have. I don't normally take state cases.<br />It is only because of your friend Willy that I endured that numbing paperwork. I'm on<br />your side. Your prognosis is very good; I doubt if you are going to have another mental<br />setback. For one thing, it hit you too late in life, which indicates it was a temporary stress<br />thing. Two, you seem to be suffering memory loss more than mental state loss, which<br />made your state more extreme but less lasting than normal schizophrenia. And your<br />story. It's solid! There are no signs of delusions of grandeur in it. level-headed.&rdquo;<br />Crazy, she doesn't even know my history. What kind of a doctor is this?<br />She went on. &ldquo;The drug, gammaxanthodeX712 that I'm giving you should<br />gradually bring back your memory. I didn't give you heavy doses because you just need a<br />little nudge up there in your brain to bring back your memory.<br />&ldquo;The drug just makes the flow easier between the pre-synapses of your brain,<br />which should allow the neurons to create, we call them boutons&mdash;to bring back your<br />memory through reactivating your mind's past reactions to stimuli. Here, take one now.<br />You need to chew &lsquo;em.&rdquo;<br />She handed him a little yellow pill and paused as he popped it in his mouth before<br />she went on.<br />&ldquo;Chew.&rdquo; Danny started chewing. &ldquo;But if you don't answer my phone calls, I have<br />to report it to the state. Otherwise I lose my license and my job. I'd rather put you back in<br />the hospital than lose my job. Yeah, I'm selfish. That's what I got to work on in this<br />lifetime. But if you don't force a crisis on me, I won't go schizo either and spend the rest<br />of my life feeling guilty I put you back in the hospital&mdash;the great writer that you might<br />turn out to be&mdash;might! But ignore me, and back in the hospital you go.&rdquo;<br />Danny had been to many psychs when he was young because his mother was<br />afraid of his antisocial behavior&mdash;but none like this one. She didn't act right. Shrinks are</p>
                        <p>far more cautious always looking for body language, their minds constantly ticking in an<br />analyzing way. This one was on speed or something. Best thing about her was she didn't<br />ask him stupid questions. In fact she didn't seem able to stop talking.<br />&ldquo;What's that under your arm, Danny?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;The reason I didn't call you for six days. I was busy writing.&rdquo;<br />That was a lie. He hadn't been writing. He had been trying to remember where he<br />had been for the past three months. Willy, and this doctor, were saying he was in the<br />mental hospital. But he couldn't remember any, of it. The papers he had under his arms<br />were chapters in his book he must have written when he lost his memory. He didn't<br />remember writing them, but there they were and they were connected to the story he was<br />writing, and they were written on his 1927 Royal typewriter. He had a question that had<br />been bothering him all this week. How could he have written these new stories on his<br />typewriter if he had been sequestered in the state hospital? Last time he was in the<br />hospital was five years ago. He was only given crayons to write with then.<br />So, at last, here come the questions, but Dr. Lei surprised him.<br />&ldquo;Well, that is an acceptable excuse. I'll tell the State you were just working too<br />hard...not a note of dishonesty in that...unless they ask me where and what you were<br />working on. Yeah, screw the state. I'll lie if I have to for you&mdash;at least a little. Could I see<br />the new chapters?&rdquo;<br />Willy told him it was essential to hand over these first two chapters to Dr. Lei. He<br />slowly handed over the first chapter.<br />&ldquo;Every chapter is more unexpected than the last. You have a hell of an<br />imagination, Danny. That's an asset. Einstein said imagination is more important than<br />knowledge. You've got both ingredients.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;God, it seems everybody knows what Einstein said, except me,&rdquo; said Danny.<br />&ldquo;Um...what do you mean by that?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Even Willy started quoting Einstein yesterday.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Yeah, Willy. He was talking about Einstein to me, too, just last week. He thinks<br />you're the next Einstein.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Sounds like Willy should be in the hospital more than me, Doc.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;You don't need to call me Doc. Name's Gail, Gail Lei. Screw the doctor part.<br />Psychiatrists are supposed to be on equal ground with their clients. You know the old<br />saying: &lsquo;The customer is always right.' Besides this is an archaic science, not like the<br />cosmology you practice, so the farther away I can get from that identity, the better off we<br />both will be. People talking to people. People honestly relating their feelings is what we<br />are about. Both of us are in bad shape in this world. In fact, everybody is crazy here. I<br />have never seen nor dreamt of a world like this in my wildest imagination. So, let's make<br />the most of it and treat each other as equals. Here shake on it.&rdquo;<br />How many worlds has she been in?<br />Danny kept thinking. If only she knew how archaic cosmology was.<br />Danny's hand was grasped strongly, as if the person next to him was trying to<br />prove her masculinity. Suddenly it hit him. He did remember this lady. But from where?<br />He knew he was supposed to know her from the hospital. Maybe that was where he<br />remembered her from.<br />&ldquo;How do you know Willy anyway? Is he your boyfriend?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Friend is a better word, Danny.&rdquo; She looked at him intensely.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;How do you know my book, Willy gave you that, too?&rdquo;<br />She nodded. And added, &ldquo;I'm excited about reading your story. Let's go to<br />lunch.&rdquo;<br />Lunch? It's morning. She is crazy.<br />Danny hesitated, &ldquo;It's not ready. It needs more work.&rdquo;<br />Gail said, &ldquo;I just want to get a gist of where it's going.&rdquo;<br />Danny was afraid reading stuff that he didn't even remember writing, she might<br />send him back to the hospital. But it seemed she wouldn't take a no.<br />&ldquo;I'll try to get it ready, give me some time.&rdquo;<br />The black inner pupils of her eyes bored into him.<br />He did remember her. But from where?<br />&ldquo;Let me just glance at it here, then.&rdquo;<br />She rose and stretched her hands out.<br />Danny hesitantly handed over the first chapter. Willy had told him to bring these<br />two chapters to Dr. Lei.The novel the Saga of the Mighty Valentine Cosmos and the<br />Tower of Time is due to be released in June of 2018. It includes the following songs on<br />the Audio book.</p>
