                            Preface to a Prelude:
                        </h4>
                        <p>Staring up into the dark and starry sky most of us would believe those magnificent celestial giants shining back at us to be gobs of gasses, nuclear chain reactions that will continue far beyond our lifetimes. No more alive than a match that is soon to use up all of its combustible agents and return to ash.</p>

                        <p>But imagine that we are multi-dimensional beings existing simultaneously in multiple universes, experiencing the same experiences through vastly different paradigms.</p>

                        <p>Imagine that in one of these universes we still retained our longing for companionship, philosophy and wonderment; but found ourselves unable to communicate with each other beyond the quantum ripples we sent throughout the universe.</p>

                        <p>Imagine that the Stars we see in our night sky are mirrored images of ourselves with the same deep longing for companionship, philosophy and wonderment.</p>

                        <p>Such is the case in <em>The Saga of the Mighty Valentine Cosmos</em>, which encompasses the greatest love story of our Universe.  A star-crossed love story between the <em>Third Master Storyteller of the
                            Valentine Cosmos </em> and a rogue comet.  Between <em>Danny</em>, a struggling
                            writer, and <em> Jeanne </em> a bartender in the slums of Honolulu. Between The
                            <em>Beautiful Gentle Red Star</em> and the Three worded <em>Baby Blue Star</em>, between <em>Robert
                            Louis Stevenson</em> and <em>Princess Ka'iulani </em>.<h4>
                            Prelude
                        </h4>

                        <p dir="ltr">
                            Stars, stranded in the deeper curvitures of space are unable to see, touch and feel others of their own kind.
                        </p>

                        <p dir="ltr">
                            The only communication they have is through Cosmic stories; rich in Philosophy, science, and religion carried between stars on cosmic thunder melodies.
                        </p>
                        <p dir="ltr">
                            These are some of those melodies that lament the loss of the Beautiful Red Star to earth, and her impending sentence to the void
                            of Nothingness; a place where you are forced to forever do the exact opposite of what you wish to do.
