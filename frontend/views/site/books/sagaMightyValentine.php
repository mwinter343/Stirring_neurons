                        <p>Staring up into the dark and starry sky most of us would believe those magnificent celestial giants shining back at us to be gobs of gasses, nuclear chain reactions that will continue far beyond our lifetimes. No more alive than a match that is soon to use up all of its combustible agents and return to ash.</p>

                        <p>But imagine that we are multi-dimensional beings existing simultaneously in multiple universes, experiencing the same experiences through vastly different paradigms.</p>

                        <p>Imagine that in one of these universes we still retained our longing for companionship, philosophy and wonderment; but found ourselves unable to communicate with each other beyond the quantum ripples we sent throughout the universe.</p>

                        <p>Imagine that the Stars we see in our night sky are mirrored images of ourselves with the same deep longing for companionship, philosophy and wonderment.</p>

                        <p>Such is the case in <em>The Saga of the Mighty Valentine Cosmos</em>, which encompasses the greatest love story of our Universe.  A star-crossed love story between the <em>Third Master Storyteller of the
                            Valentine Cosmos </em> and a rogue comet.  Between <em>Danny</em>, a struggling
                            writer, and <em> Jeanne </em> a bartender in the slums of Honolulu. Between The
                            <em>Beautiful Gentle Red Star</em> and the Three worded <em>Baby Blue Star</em>, between <em>Robert
                            Louis Stevenson</em> and <em>Princess Ka'iulani </em>.<h4>

                        <h4>INTRODUCTION TO THE SAGA OF THE MIGHTY VALENTINE COSMOS</h4>

                        <h4>AND THE TOWER OF TIME</h4>

                        <p>Being clueless in physics, I got scared when I realized I needed a cosmological physical</p>

                        <p>structure to finish a love story.&#160; The story is always sacred. I love them from day one, and I hate</p>

                        <p>to abandon a story for any reason. &#160;So, to my shock, I actually found myself peeking into physics</p>

                        <p>books. That lead me to a half year of sleepless nights wandering the streets of Honolulu, my mind</p>

                        <p>ballooning out of control. And after staggering around half the night ripping my mind apart on the</p>

                        <p>subject of the cosmic structure of the story, I had to go to work the next day with little sleep. Then</p>

                        <p>in one 24-hour span, I had a break-through, and was able to finish this book with its surprising</p>

                        <p>conclusion. Novels are fiction but they need to make sense. So this is the story of my break-</p>

                        <p>through and a few false leads I followed, before I was able to take this story to its rational</p>

                        <p>conclusion.</p>

                        <p>&#160; THE STORY OF ME AND THAT SASSY PHOTON.</p>

                        <p>Quantum theory is hard to understand, but my God, the theory of relativity is worse.</p>

                        <p>The Theory of Relativity says if you are going the speed of light, there is no time, no space,</p>

                        <p>no mass. If you want to shake up neurons in your head, phantom that.&#160; How can you be going</p>

                        <p>anywhere in no space and no time? &#160;I mean think about.&#160; Science says light from the Big Bang</p>

                        <p>traveled googles and googles of distances in miles to get to me. That&rsquo;s space in a big time way.&#160;</p>

                        <p>And it took a mountain of time to do that!</p>

                        <p>Then try imagine something going that far in no space, and in no time. I mean what did it go</p>

                        <p>through to get to me, if not space and time? Is there a top secret route through the universe we</p>

                        <p>don&rsquo;t know about?</p>

                        <p>I can see that little smug light particle now. It is called a photon.&#160; Might be better to call it a</p>

                        <p>foolton. There it is, lounging in an imaginary space, what else can you call the space it dwells</p>

                        <p>within, drifting in a nowhere land but going a zillion miles a minute as determined by</p>

                        <p>measurements of the scientists. It has got to be laughing, &ldquo;Yeah right, I moved. Ha, ha, ha.&rdquo;</p>

                        <p>But I&rsquo;m not laughing. Instead I&rsquo;m moving in creeping, gas fuming, morning traffic, with one or</p>

                        <p>two hours of sleep, struggling to get to work on time so I can work my ass off sweating in</p>

                        <p>sluggish&rsquo; time and space. &#160;I hate that photon.&#160; That privileged, lazy bastard.&#160;</p>

                        <p>And in the distance I see this mountain range.&#160;</p>

                        <p>&#160; I shouldn&rsquo;t say that, anymore.&#160; I am really seeing this brown mound with a touch of green.</p>

                        <p>Somehow I have been brain washed into believing it is a mountain range.&#160;Hey, get real, Norm.&#160;</p>

                        <p>I&rsquo;m looking. It ain&rsquo;t no mountain range.&#160; It is just a brown haze in the distance with a smidgen of</p>

                        <p>green. How am I gonna figure out that photon if I start imagining what isn&rsquo;t there? That so called</p>

                        <p>mountain is just a plain green and brown haze in the distance.</p>

                        <p>No bushes, no trees, no little animals, no little bugs, not even an ant, just a plain brown and</p>

                        <p>green mound in the distance.</p>

                        <p>Bushes, trees, little animals, little bugs and ants must have photons hitting my eyes from that</p>

                        <p>mound, but I don&rsquo;t see them. Weird.</p>

                        <p>I&rsquo;m upset.&#160; Why can&rsquo;t I see an ant climbing a little blade of grass precariously holding on as</p>

                        <p>the soft trade winds blow the blade of grass here and there?&#160; Why can&rsquo;t I see that?</p>

                        <p>I get to work late. My co-worker, Jess, says, as I barge in the door, &ldquo;You look terrible.&rdquo;</p>

                        <p>&#160; I stormed toward the computer.&#160; Her little son is on it.&#160; I scream for him to get off.&#160; The six-</p>

                        <p>year-old says, &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t talk like that,&rdquo; I apologize with Jess glaring at me and tell Jupiter,</p>

                        <p>that&rsquo;s the little kid&rsquo;s name, &ldquo;I&#160;gotta look for an ant.&rdquo; &#160;I lift the kid off the chair, google the &ldquo;Waianae</p>

                        <p>Mountains,&rdquo; get an aerial shot. Zoom in, lumps, maybe they are bushes, dirt, but no ant, kid</p>

                        <p>screaming.</p>

                        <p>Jess glares at me again. &#160;I glare at the computer.</p>

                        <p>People are lining up to sell their phonograph records. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been doing for the</p>

                        <p>past sixty years.</p>

                        <p>Work finishes.&#160; It is night now.&#160; I drive home. The moon is on the horizon.&#160; It looks bigger</p>

                        <p>than normal. I think I can probably leap and touch it if I ever get to the horizon.&#160; Shit, it&rsquo;s almost</p>

                        <p>touching the Earth, no wonder it is so big.&#160; There are no ants on the moon. I don&rsquo;t have a problem</p>

                        <p>with the moon.&#160; It&rsquo;s that mound in the distance. I&amp;#39;ve been told&#160;there is an ant up there.</p>

                        <p>I pull over on the shoulder of the freeway.&#160; Jump out, look back at that mound in the</p>

                        <p>distance.&#160; Shit, it is not even there, just a bunch of lights in the distance and a few lights in the</p>

                        <p>zenith of the sky. &#160;Science calls those lights in the sky &ldquo;stars.&rdquo; How come I can see the moon but</p>

                        <p>not the mound?&#160; Of course.&#160;The Sun is still shining on the moon, but the Earth at night is not</p>

                        <p>facing the Sun.&#160; I need the Sun&rsquo;s light to see that mound. Weird. Shouldn&rsquo;t I be able to see a</p>

                        <p>photon, not just what it bounced off of? Nah, how do you see an object in space-time who isn&rsquo;t</p>

                        <p>even in space-time.</p>

                        <p>A cop pulls over. &#160;&ldquo;Car trouble?&rdquo;</p>

                        <p>&#160; &ldquo;No, mountain trouble.&rdquo;&#160;</p>

                        <p>&ldquo;Get going, smart ass.&rdquo;</p>

                        <p>I&rsquo;m back on the freeway heading for the moon on the horizon.</p>

                        <p>&#160;Science says they&rsquo;ve measured light&rsquo;s speed from the moon. The image of the moon is</p>

                        <p>really not there.&#160; Yeah, it was there a second or two ago.&#160; That&rsquo;s how much time it takes the light</p>

                        <p>bouncing off the moon from the Sun to reach my eyes. So it is not there now.&#160; It is in a past,</p>

                        <p>before now. &#160;And it is big. Heck, science says the moon is one third the size of the entire Earth.</p>

                        <p>Those lights in the zenith of the sky, they are even bigger.&#160; Science says they are about the size</p>

                        <p>of a million Earths. &#160;But they are not in the sky now.&#160; Science says those are images of star</p>

                        <p>systems many years ago because it took light that long to haul an image of that star to me. Shit!</p>

                        <p>See the pattern here.&#160; THE BIGGER THE OBJECT. THE FARTHER AWAY IT IS. &#8230;AND</p>

                        <p>THE FARTHER AWAY IT IS, THE FARTHER INTO THE PAST IT IS.</p>

                        <p>Example: Galaxies are even bigger than stars.&#160; Science says there are billions of star</p>

                        <p>systems within them. The image of galaxies hasn&rsquo;t traveled years to reach me. It has traveled</p>

                        <p>millions of years to reach me. Science says the Universe, the aftermath of the Big Bang, when</p>

                        <p>seen through a telescope from outside it, is incredibly bigger in mass, and to see it in its whole</p>

                        <p>when light finally exploded from it,&#160;has taken billions of years for its light to reach me.</p>

                        <p>Now that mound I saw in the morning is but a millionth of a second away by light. It is not</p>

                        <p>there now. Why so close?&#160;Because it is far smaller in mass than even the moon.</p>

                        <p>Everything I see is in a past.&#160; Smaller things in a shorter past from me. The bigger the</p>

                        <p>thing, the farther away it is to me, in both time and space. Why? &#160;Do photons expand with</p>

                        <p>distant? &#160;Are photons that fat? &#160;How can a massless object be fat?</p>

                        <p>Could the massless photon be the ENTIRE UNIVERSE! Then it wouldn&rsquo;t need to move an</p>

                        <p>iota. It wouldn&rsquo;t need time or space if it was really the whole universe.&#160; It would be just there.</p>

                        <p>Yeah, right. How can a massless object be the whole universe?</p>

                        <p>Let&rsquo;s look at it a different way. &#160;What about littler and littler things? Tiny masses.&#160; Like</p>

                        <p>subatomic particles.&#160; Wait.&#160; Science says I can&rsquo;t see them at all. They are so tiny they don&rsquo;t act</p>

                        <p>like regular objects. They are only probabilities. Like my futures? &#160;I might be here, or there,</p>

                        <p>tomorrow, but it is impossible for me to be on Mars tomorrow. It is merely a probability where I will</p>

                        <p>be. Is my future the same as subatomic particles? Science says subatomic particles can be here</p>

                        <p>or there, but they can&rsquo;t be everywhere, just like my futures.</p>

                        <p>&#160; If lesser mass worlds are in futures, maybe the ant is the same thing!&#160; It&rsquo;s a lesser mass</p>

                        <p>than me. If light leads toward larger and larger things with distance, yeah, how could I see an ant</p>

                        <p>in the distance? Duh, I should have thought of that.</p>

                        <p>So that ant is in my future light.&#160; Like subatomic particles.</p>

                        <p>What is the future? &#160;Shit, at least it&rsquo;s something I haven&rsquo;t messed up yet.</p>

                        <p>I haven&rsquo;t messed up the ant because I can&rsquo;t see it yet and it can&amp;#39;t see me. I haven&rsquo;t brought</p>

                        <p>it into my consciousness. I haven&rsquo;t messed up that subatomic particle tell I get obsessed with</p>

                        <p>meddling with it. I&rsquo;m like an elephant in a mirror maze at a carnival. I&rsquo;m breaking glass</p>

                        <p>everywhere, and when it shatters, I&rsquo;m seeing things that weren&rsquo;t there before.</p>

                        <p>It&rsquo;s like my consciousness, my now, distorts or disturbs everything around me.&#160;</p>

                        <p>But my consciousness can&rsquo;t do anything to that photon. He&rsquo;s not in space-time. Any temper</p>

                        <p>tantrum I concoct in space-time, and that photon is totally oblivious to my gyrating and screaming.</p>

                        <p>My &ldquo;now&rdquo; is awareness of my being and knowing my size place in this scheme, while being</p>

                        <p>propelled into the future of momentary time, yet still looking at a different past, because light, that</p>

                        <p>sassy photon, only leads me toward a past. It is like I am in one universe slipping into a future</p>

                        <p>while encompassing my whole body with awareness, that&rsquo;s me, and then outside of me is another</p>

                        <p>universe propelling away from me. I&rsquo;m in one universe aware of another that is slipping away.</p>

                        <p>That is my consciousness, my now</p>

                        <p>Yet, I look at the world as if it is there, regardless of my consciousness.&#160; Yeah, but when</p>

                        <p>you incorporate the &ldquo;now&rsquo;&mdash;the instant of consciousness, a whole new perspective appears. And</p>

                        <p>might it not be a distorted perspective? Maybe real distorted?&#160;</p>

                        <p>And what is science seeing that makes them think that photon is moving?&#160; Science</p>

                        <p>measures its &ldquo;starting place&rdquo; and then our &ldquo;now&rdquo; of it reaching us.&#160; Science is really measuring</p>

                        <p>our consciousness of that photon. And then science compares that with what we have been doing</p>

                        <p>in space-time here on a tiny morsel of the universe (awareness of our bodies) during a smidgen</p>

                        <p>of time, (a series of moments, &ldquo;nows,&rdquo; we maintain in our memory).</p>

                        <p>The photon is encompassing everything. I mean if you are in no space and no time how</p>

                        <p>can you&#160;not&#160;encompass the whole universe of space-time, while we encompass but a small</p>

                        <p>smidgen of the universe&rsquo;s space-time.</p>

                        <p>Could it be my consciousness, (my now), stuck in a small place, is trying to absorb the big</p>

                        <p>space, the universe itself, by trying to catch pictures of the bigger world inside the smaller world?</p>

                        <p>I can&rsquo;t see the universe all at once. It&rsquo;s too big. Then I got to see it in pieces. Is time but little</p>

                        <p>chunks of space time I hunger to keep gobbling up, to see the entire Cosmos? &#160; Hungering to see</p>

                        <p>everything, I stretch myself to be a bigger part of the Cosmos by pushing time to see little chunks</p>

                        <p>of the universe in succession.</p>

                        <p>Meanwhile that sassy photon doesn&rsquo;t give a shit about space-time, &lsquo;cause it is</p>

                        <p>encompassing the whole universe from beyond space-time.</p>

                        <p>Hey, consciousness might be the need to see or be the whole universe, but trapped here</p>

                        <p>in a dot of space-time, it is having a real frustrating time.</p>

                        <p>Okay I&rsquo;m at a spot, moving.&#160; Where is the photon? Not moving in no space and no time.</p>

                        <p>&#160;Duh, of course. It is impossible to move in space-time if you are not&#160;even&#160;in.&#160;space-time.&#160; So</p>

                        <p>Something&rsquo;s wrong, it is appearing to be moving. Could consciousness be getting a distorted</p>

                        <p>picture of what that photon is doing? Of its moving. &#160;What else could it be? Or is it moving</p>

                        <p>somewhere else, outside of space-time? And when we look we are bringing it into our</p>

                        <p>consciousness, which is in space-time. Maybe we are yanking light out of where it is from, and</p>

                        <p>plopping it into our consciousness. But how? It is not even in space-time.</p>

                        <p>My thoughts are rambling now.&#160; I need to find a place to put the photon and find a place for</p>

                        <p>me to be, relative to the photon.</p>

                        <p>I got an idea. What is the shape of the universe? All large bodies, the planets, and the</p>

                        <p>stars are spherical in shape.&#160; Science says because of gravity.&#160; Well, the whole universe is real</p>

                        <p>big, has tons of gravity, so why not the universe itself, be spherical, be like our globe</p>

                        <p>Let&rsquo;s for a moment think of the universe as a sphere. I know science doesn&rsquo;t think that. So</p>

                        <p>far they have no proof of its real shape, spherical is just less likely. But let&rsquo;s just think of the</p>

                        <p>universe as a globe and see what happens.</p>

                        <p>Subatomic particles with tiny masses would be closest to the north pole, maybe at the</p>

                        <p>arctic circle, atoms might be at 54 degrees north latitude, we at 45 degree north latitude, stars at</p>

                        <p>33 degrees north latitude, galaxies at the tropic of cancer, the universe at the equator. The little</p>

                        <p>masses are near the top of the universe globe, the biggest mass, the entire universe, is at the</p>

                        <p>equator, all these sizes spinning around the universe globe.</p>

                        <p>The point is, when it comes to consciousness, we need to place ourselves somewhere,</p>

                        <p>and the universe somewhere else. These size waves (subatomic, atoms, us, stars, galaxies,</p>

                        <p>universe) are moving at the same speed (the speed of light) in the same direction around the</p>

                        <p>Cosmic Globe.</p>

                        <p>But in my position, the speed of light is locked in one place at the latitude of 45 degrees</p>

                        <p>north. The difference is that we are all transiting different sizes of space. We are conscious of our</p>

                        <p>personal space. The subatomic particles are conscious of their place and make a complete circle</p>

                        <p>of the cosmic globe in the arctic circle quicker than we do at 45 degrees north latitude. So even</p>

                        <p>though we are both moving at the speed of light, from our vantage point, our now, it seems they</p>

                        <p>are moving faster than the speed of light.&#160; That would account for the magic interconnecting of</p>

                        <p>subatomic particles that appear to connect faster than the speed of light.&#160; It would also solve the</p>

                        <p>horizon problem. We are seeing a distorted picture of subatomic particles because our now</p>

                        <p>(consciousness) is moving in larger space.</p>

                        <p>See how is it when you add consciousness, the &ldquo;now?&rdquo;.&#160; It distorts the cosmos you dwell</p>

                        <p>within.</p>

                        <p>And what about the stars and galaxies and the universe?&#160; They appear to be moving slower</p>

                        <p>than us via light because it takes them longer to make a spin around the Cosmic globe.&#160; That</p>

                        <p>explains why we think the universe is expanding.&#160; It appears that way because we seem to be</p>

                        <p>falling away from larger masses not realizing it is really a distorted illusion, as larger objects are</p>

                        <p>forced to travel longer to make a circle around the Cosmic globe.&#160;</p>

                        <p>It is not even an illusion. Viewing lesser space moving at a faster speed of light than us, and</p>

                        <p>larger space moving at a slower speed of light than us, it is creating a brand new dimension.&#160; We</p>

                        <p>could be living in fifth dimensional space-time. Just imagine viewing a different speed of light from</p>

                        <p>our speed of light. A shift in the speed of light would emit a fantastic new amount of energy.</p>

                        <p>(Energy equals Mass time the speed of light squared).</p>

                        <p>Is that what the quantum foam-- -energy bigger than a universe in the tiniest space (the</p>

                        <p>Plank Space of lesser space) and dark energy (the force that seems to have our universe</p>

                        <p>accelerating toward oblivion in larger space), are these gigantic energies really just viewing</p>

                        <p>another speed of light. Or if things are moving faster or slower than our speed of light, could we</p>

                        <p>even see them? Could we even see the stars and galaxies? Maybe if they are moving faster than</p>

                        <p>the speed of light like subatomic particles we can&rsquo;t see them, and when moving slower than the</p>

                        <p>speed of light relative to us, we can see them expanding away from us? But how do we see a</p>

                        <p>slower speed of light? Ah, that photon.</p>

                        <p>That photon connects different times into my now. Maybe it also connects different speeds</p>

                        <p>of light.</p>

                        <p>So where is the photon in this picture?</p>

                        <p>&#160; Its fat ass is just lounging with a lollipop in its mouth at the north pole, making one spin in</p>

                        <p>no space and no time, just watching the universe expand away from its perch at the north pole,</p>

                        <p>and making a complete trip around the universe globe. Then, cause of its lazy position, it has no</p>

                        <p>problem with connecting the universe together through its vertical longitude motion that stretches</p>

                        <p>to the equator. &#160;So at the north pole it goes around the universe in an istant where it is at the top</p>

                        <p>of the universe globe. And we see it moving through its arrow from lesser space futures to larger</p>

                        <p>space pasts. Think what you like about my universe globe, BUT HOW ELSE COULD YOU</p>

                        <p>POSSIBLY EXPLAIN LIGHT MOVING IN NO SPACE AND NO TIME! It is at the north pole</p>

                        <p>making one spin around the cosmic globe in no time and no space. While at the same time</p>

                        <p>connecting other time and spaces and other speeds of light relative to ours through its vertical</p>

                        <p>motion across the cosmic globe.</p>

                        <p>In the Saga of the Mighty Valentine Cosmos and the Tower of Time, I use that structure to</p>

                        <p>carry the story to its fruition. I couldn&rsquo;t resolve this book without me uncovering this structure. And</p>

                        <p>I believe all stories, truly followed, lead to a better understanding of the world about us. So I&rsquo;ll</p>

                        <p>pass this hot potato to science. Maybe they can verify our consciousness is seeing different</p>

                        <p>speeds of light relative to our mass. Or shed a few more lights on the problem.</p>

                        <p>After all, how are we gonna solve the problems of cosmology without knowing our place in</p>

                        <p>this realm. What are we looking through to see what we see and from where? We could very</p>

                        <p>likely be seeing an incredibly distorted picture through our consciousness.</p>

                        <p>So that image of a star in the sky whose light traveled nine light years to reach me, is not</p>

                        <p>the same nine years in the past as what I was doing nine years ago.&#160;There are two separate</p>

                        <p>pasts. And the future of subatomic particles (their probabilities) is not the same future</p>

                        <p>(probabilities) of what I will be doing tomorrow. There are two pasts and two futures, three</p>

                        <p>dimensions of space, two dimensions of time. We might be living in fifth dimensional space-time.</p>

                        <p>The fifth arrow being light moving from lesser space futures to larger space pasts. The second</p>

                        <p>arrow of time moving in reverse to our consciousness of the now.</p>

                        <p>Different speeds of light. Are we witnessing that? What is a border of a universe? Where</p>

                        <p>can&rsquo;t you go in a universe?&#160; It&rsquo;s not a space-time thing. I mean we could go forever and what</p>

                        <p>would prevent us from going and going in our universe. Oh maybe, we could go all around our</p>

                        <p>universe and return to this place. But what is the border?&#160; You can go all around the Earth and</p>

                        <p>you still have the sky, the stars, the universe as your border. What about a universe? What</p>

                        <p>makes one universe different from another? Where&rsquo;s the barrier between one universe and</p>

                        <p>another?</p>

                        <p>I came to the simplest conclusion. The speed of light is our border.&#160; We can&rsquo;t go faster than</p>

                        <p>the speed of light, or we wouldn&rsquo;t be in this universe. In fact, going faster than the speed of light</p>

                        <p>and cause and effect would be annihilated. The event would appear before the cause.&#160; Sorry</p>

                        <p>science-fiction writers and Star War fans. The force won&rsquo;t be with you going faster than the speed</p>

                        <p>of light. The speed of light is our boundary of the universe. We have but one restriction in our</p>

                        <p>universe, our speed of light. &#160;A different speed of light and you are in a different universe. &#160;I mean</p>

                        <p>that was figured out a full hundred years ago by the genius, Eisenstein. The same guy that</p>

                        <p>figured out that photons are in no space, no time, with no mass. The same guy who figured out</p>

                        <p>that going faster than the speed of light and the effect happens before the cause. That&rsquo;s way</p>

                        <p>beyond &ldquo;fast.&rdquo;</p>

                        <p>Then think of this.&#160; There are immense differences in the size of things.&#160; From subatomic to</p>

                        <p>atomic, to molecules, to us, to stars, to galaxies to the universe itself with absolutely no gradual</p>

                        <p>sizes in between. If the speed of light is the boundary of a universe, are these different sizes a</p>

                        <p>part of our universe? In this picture they appear to be moving at a different speed of light.&#160; They</p>

                        <p>are a new term I might call relative universes.&#160; They are universes that need each other to exist.</p>

                        <p>We need the stars, galaxies, subatomic particles to exist, BUT THEIR SPEED OF LIGHT</p>

                        <p>RELATIVE TO OUR CONSCIOUSNESS IS DIFFERENT. &#160;In this scenario, A RELATIVE</p>

                        <p>UNIVERSE IS THE TIME IT TAKES TO MAKE A CIRCLE AROUND THE COSMIC GLOBE AT</p>

                        <p>THE SPEED OF LIGHT. And this fifth dimension, this arrow of light from lesser space futures to</p>

                        <p>larger space pasts is the connection between us and these other relative universes. It&rsquo;s a new</p>

                        <p>line of sight via the photon that goes from lesser mass futures (subatomic particles) to larger</p>

                        <p>space masses (stars, galaxies and the universe) on a second, vertical arrow of time. While our</p>

                        <p>other arrow of time is the speed of light going around the cosmic globe horizontally at 45 degrees</p>

                        <p>latitude.</p>

                        <p>Next morning, I arrive at work.&#160; Jess says, &ldquo;Ah, you look better today.&rdquo;&#160; I hug Jupiter &rdquo;I&rsquo;m</p>

                        <p>sorry, kid.&rdquo;</p>

                        <p>Jess smiles. &ldquo;Why, you so happy today?&rdquo;</p>

                        <p>&ldquo;I found out how that smart ass photon cheats.&rdquo;</p>

                        <p>Little known to Jess, on that very morning, I found out how to continue the Saga of the</p>

                        <p>Mighty Valentine Cosmos and the Tower of Time.</p>

                        <p>Everything at last fell together,</p>

                        <p>&#160; So if you want to know a love story that happens in these exotic relative universes where</p>

                        <p>subatomic particles, atoms, us, stars, quasar-galaxies, and even the universe are all living</p>

                        <p>beings, having their own consciousness of a &ldquo;now,&rdquo; and playing in multiple, relative, universes</p>

                        <p>simultaneously. just listen to the love story of The Saga of the Mighty Valentine Cosmos (the</p>

                        <p>horizontal arrow of time) and the Tower of Time. (the vertical line of time).</p>

                        <p>Listen with your heart first, and in time the mind will comprehend. For in the end, love</p>

                        <p>seems to be the dominate force. Our whole Cosmos might really be but a love story we all play</p>

                        <p>out day by day.</p>
