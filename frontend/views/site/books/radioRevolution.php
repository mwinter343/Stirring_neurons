                            <h3>The Radio Revolution is the story of how America could be turned upside down and changed into a real democracy. </h3>The mechanism of change that causes this
                            is the evaporation of money from the political system via an amendment to the constitution. Only Government funds can be used to pay for all political campaigns.
                            This signals the end of parties. The end of big business lobbies and unfair tax breaks. The end of religious endeavors to change behaviors.

                            The Radio Revolution is an historic fiction centering on a popular radio
                            station here in Hawaii, Radio Free Hawaii (1991-1997). It is a station I created. And knowing what I know now, this is how it might have really survived
                            beyond seven turbulent years. This is how it might have blossomed to make America, itself, a real democracy.

                            The history of rock n roll and the history of radio go hand in hand.
                            In the fifties radio was actually sensitive to listeners' requests and
                            allowed rock n roll to reach the masses. If rock n roll was to
                            suddenly become popular today it would remain underground, squashed by
                            big business and a monopoly rating service. There would be no Beatles,
                            no Rolling Stones, there would be no flower children and Woodstock, it
                            would be what radio is today, a limp rag of white noise.

                            If you don't believe me you might think otherwise when you read the
                            Radio Revolution, the story of how radio came to suck. And how what
                            happened to radio happened in all of America's mass marketing.

                            In a rare thirteen weeks on radio station 107.9FM in Honolulu, before
                            I was kicked off the air, I had a one hour weekly radio show called
                            the History of Rock N Roll For Extrateresstials telling the history of
                            rock n roll and radio's part and how radio came to suck.  These are
                            those shows.
