                            <p>I&rsquo;ve got a loving wife, three step kids, two of which think I&rsquo;m a God, a nice union job, and guess what?</p>
                        </h3>
                        <p>The IRS thinks I&rsquo;m a tax dodger and the FBI has wired my house with cameras and microphones.</p>

                        <p>I know why. I&rsquo;m Mexican. Mexicans are rapist and serial killers and only take their pay in cash. The gringo needs to be on constant alert for the next Mexican felony.</p>

                        <p>My name is Grandville Rodriquez and if the gringo likes to worry about Mexicans, then I might just give the gringo something to really worry about.</p>

                        <p>I&rsquo;ll admit, I am a bit obsessive, pounding sign slogans on walls and ceilings of my Canoga Park Home with such vengeance the plaster breaks. Usually they are about the gringo. Last night, on the living room ceiling, I pounded a sign slogan with these words, &ldquo;Once the gringo says it, he thinks he has done it. Why bother really doing it? Didn&rsquo;t you hear? &lsquo;I just said it, it&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;</p>

                        <p>Tonight we were at the dinner table. The gringo was in the wall with his microphone and camera. We got talking. My wife said, &ldquo;If you have lots of money you can do anything you want.&rdquo;</p>

                        <p>I said, &ldquo;Exactly. The gringo goes after money so he can do anything he wants. He&rsquo;s uncooperative by nature. The Mexican doesn&rsquo;t go after money as hard because he is cooperative. And when the Gringo gets more money what does he do? He shits on the Mexican to become even more uncooperative.&rdquo;</p>

                        <p>My eight-year-old stepson, Teddy, said, &ldquo;We, the La Raza, need to wipe out the gringo.&rdquo;</p>

                        <p>I said, &ldquo;Then we would be uncooperative, too.&rdquo;</p>

                        <p>There was silence at the dinner table. Only the gnawing inside one&rsquo;s mouth and the tingling of silverware as it dropped on the plates.</p>

                        <p>Then I said it. &ldquo;If money is what makes the Gringo uncooperative. Then, we've simply got to eliminate money.&rdquo;</p>

                        <p>Renaldo, the middle child, said, &quot;Do you think the gringo will just let us take their money away?&quot;</p>

                        <p>Staring at the gringo in the wall, I said, with a smile, &quot;The gringos can keep their precious money and possessions, We&rsquo;ll just make them worthless. Maybe then they&rsquo;ll consider being more cooperative. I&rsquo;m Mexican. When I say I&rsquo;m going to do it, I really do it.&quot;</p>
