                        </h4>
                        <p>This is my writing.&nbsp; I write books.&nbsp; I write short stories. I write songs. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll get off my duff soon and publish some of them.</p>
                        <p>Writers are storytellers so don&rsquo;t ask what part of this is true and what part is fiction. I&rsquo;m just telling you a story.</p>
                        <p>One beautiful lady said it this way.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is no fiction. There is no non-fiction, there is only the story real somewhere, somewhere else but a dream. But that else place, is really no place different at all.&rdquo;</p>
                        <p>She was an expert on these kind of matters, a bar hostess in the slums of Honolulu.&nbsp; She got to hear bar customer stories every night. Of course they were bullshit, but she was so cool.&nbsp; In tribute, I dedicated one of my novels to her.</p>
                        <p>My three novels are quite different from each other. If they have anything in common, they try to stir up the neurons in your head and place them in unfamiliar places.</p>
                        <p>The first neurons I stirred into unfamiliar places was to my English teacher when I was a senior&nbsp;in high school.&nbsp; We were assigned to write a three-thousand-word story for our final.&nbsp;Any kind of story was okay, even a children&rsquo;s story, assuming such an effort would prove if we knew sentence structure and punctuation.</p>
                        <p>I cheated. I had written a Dick and Jane story about Dick and the Steam Shovel when I was seven years old, my only experiment in creative writing. So I expanded it a little. It was about one thousand words and I needed three thousand.</p>
                        <p>It just so happened this English class was in 1959, just two&nbsp;years after they built a damn dam in Page, Arizona that turned the mighty Colorado River into a wimpy creek. Most of the parents of the kids in school worked on that damn dam, and in 1957 there was a party on the streets of Page that lasted a whole week celebrating the completion of that damn dam.</p>
                        <p>I didn&rsquo;t join in on the party. Instead alone, I sat on the banks of a little creek once named the Mighty Colorado River, and drank beer, stewing, while kicking the once moist, now dry, earth, while reminiscing about my trips with a kayak down the rapids of the mighty Colorado into the Grand Canyon. &nbsp;It was a daring, exciting, sometimes life threating ride, with incredible beautiful rock symmetry.</p>
                        <p>Now, suddenly, with the damn dam, the Colorado River was a wimpy little stream and the nearby Indian reservation in Page, wow, their food gardens and farms suddenly shriveled up in the arid Arizona climate.</p>
                        <p>So my Dick, and the Steam Shovel story got extended, as I stared at that giant wall stuffing the life out of mighty Colorado River.</p>
                        <p>That was fifty-nine years ago.&nbsp; Six years ago my mother died.&nbsp; She had always told me I needed to be a writer but I laughed it off.&nbsp; How would she know?&nbsp;&nbsp; But in her belongings I found Dick and the Steam Shovel.</p>
                        <p>&ldquo;This is great!&rdquo; I said, reading the handwritten story.</p>
                        <p>So in retrospect, I thought I might share with you my first effort at storytelling, A Dick and Jane story started at seven and extended at seventeen for my senior English final.</p>
                        <p>Push the play button, and the story will begin.</p>

                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            <br>
                            My mother had me, a baby destined to death before his first year.<br />
                            Still she and my father fought desperately to keep me alive. The doctors told my parents to let go, there is no chance. I didn&rsquo;t have normal intestines to absorb nutrients. <br />
                            They went for second and third and fourth opinions. Finally, they found a doctor named Dr. Cherry. He told my parents to get bananas, rotten ones, not brown, but black, and feed it to your baby. I would eat anything, my body desperately looking for nutrients. Dr. Cherry saved my life.<br />
                            Black, rotten bananas fermented in my stomach creating new enzymes that eventually were able to absorb food. So for four years that is all I ate. I had huge side-affects. scurvy, rickets, iron deficiencies that made my tan skin, (because I was forced to stay outside most of the time to absorb vitamin D), potted with huge white spots. I didn&rsquo;t walk until I was four years old, only babbling incoherently until I was seven. My father was killed in an automobile accident and my mother put in a mental hospital with a nervous breakdown, when I was four, I was then sent to the Sawtell Retarded Home. Yes, that is what they called special education in those days. I guess I appeared listless, with no parents around and all. <br />
                            Basically I looked like a third world malnourished child with a potbelly caused from inflamed intestines. <br />
                            But I had a brother. Boy, did I have a brother. He protected me furiously from outside intrusion when I got out of the retarded school, despite being two and half years younger. Other kids made fun of me or terrorized me. And when I went to regular school when I was seven, my cousin, that valedictorian, protected me from all the other kids trying to beat me up, too.<br />
                            My brother&rsquo;s name was John. And in my book, the Autobiograffiti of Grandville Rodriquez, the second chapter is pretty much the truth of my relationship with my brother and his exploits in youth. Most of those amazing events really happened. He did send a letter to Truman and got an FBI agent at the door wondering if who wrote that letter had any communist affiliations. When Butch&rsquo;s gang hung me from a tree with the rope around my neck, I had to save myself from hanging by holding on to the rope until my brother found me. Then he did start that war with Butches Gang, armed with wheel barrels of bricks and slaughtered Butch&rsquo;s &ldquo;fuck you,&rdquo; parrot. And I did get 24 misplaced verbenas when I told my brother a storytelling lie, and he did build that fort, and fought desperately to hold it when the police raided the lot, and the city did destroy it, and we did wreck the buses and police cars in retribution, And he did have that paper for five years that was called the Weekly 24 (not the scrawling wall) and I did scotch tape a paper clip to the ad on each paper, And he did have the bottle route and was a major entrepreneur between the ages eight and fourteen. And he did die at twenty-three.<br />
                            Of course being a storyteller, I changed his name to Rudolpho and made us into Mexicans to make the story better in contrast, but that&rsquo;s what storytellers do. Yeah? That&rsquo;s why you can never trust a storyteller to be absolutely factual.<br />
                            If the truth is a little better with an extra twist, you know I&rsquo;m gonna use the twist. But to me, it is still the &ldquo;truth,&rdquo; just more visible, truth. My brother never understood that.<br />
                            And he was the writer. He wrote tons of poetry, and wrote a huge psychology book on how the mind works and how it rationalizes what it is doing by following the body&rsquo;s emotional paths, and then following those emotional paths the mind rationalizes our mind. In short he showed how we lie to ourselves constantly by creating what he called &ldquo;conducts of flash memories&rdquo; in order to justify our actions. The mind is the great twister and it needs a skyhook to move and exist, and the skyhook, is basically a necessary lie, so it can continue.<br />
                            That piece of literature was probably inspired by him living with me. <br />
                            And I was the exact opposite. I, at eighteen, nineteen and twenty was mister happy go lucky, never thought about anything deeply, laughed at people telling me I&rsquo;m not responsible. I didn&rsquo;t have any goals, except songwriting and music retail, which no one would give me a chance at, and no one thought that was a sufficient goal to live your life for, anyway. I would do anything anybody asked without a second thought. not worrying if it would hurt me or someone else in the process. Didn&rsquo;t mind living and sleeping in a Falcon car, drinking cases of V8 juice or free loading at friends&rsquo; homes for food and sleeping and quitting jobs constantly or being fired. One year I had, maybe, twenty different jobs. And in constant fear the V8 juice or gas would run out before I got the next job. <br />
                            So when I got back to Fort Ord, three months before I was going to go back to Korea, I got the news.<br />
                            My brother had tried to commit suicide.<br />
                            It was November 15th, 1966. I got emergency leave and drove down to LA and talked with my brother.<br />
                            He was in college in Tustin, California. That&rsquo;s when I read that handwritten book he wrote called &ldquo;Mind Tricks and Lies we use to exist.&rdquo;<br />
                            We spent five days together, noticed he was drinking hard liquor but still penetrating my mind with one question after another. He decided if he was gonna stay on this planet he had to build a lie that suggested our mother didn&rsquo;t exist. Unfortunately, that sent him into depression, because he refused to lie to himself, but if he was gonna stay here, he would have to start lying to himself. That&rsquo;s why he attempted suicide.<br />
                            My mother was a problem. She married a man when I was eighteen and my brother was fifteen. My stepfather wouldn&rsquo;t let me in the house, me, the irresponsible, high school drop-out, one with no reasonable goals for life. My brother said later, my stepfather kicked me out of the house in fear I was contaminating his own kids&rsquo; minds. My brother lived with them and my mother and my step-father thought he was so responsible, dutiful, the perfect son, but when he went to college and got poor grades, these horrific letters were sent to him telling him to &ldquo;face life, be responsible.&rdquo; <br />
                            My brother was more dependent on my mother than me, I think. And with her about face under the influence of her new husband, the solution was clear. &ldquo;I have no mother.&rdquo; But it was lie. My brother had zero tolerance for lying. That&rsquo;s why the suicide attempt.<br />
                            To me it was simple. You had a wonderful mother who got trapped into a horrible influence, hell John, you know she has always been somewhat unstable, she needs to hold on to something, and she just found the wrong thing to hold on to. Enjoy the good years. It is now time to separate. You&rsquo;ve got a wonderful girlfriend. Transfer your love to her.&rdquo;<br />
                            He said, &ldquo;You separate yourself from love, you live in shadows the rest of your life. You might as well as not live at all. And you live with intense pain of what you&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo;<br />
                            How could we be brothers? We were exact opposites. But the bond was there, only more intense now under this crisis.<br />
                            We did make a plan. He would move to a new college, a new situation, and when I got out of the service in three months I would live with him. And he would leave no forwarding address and my mother, she wouldn&rsquo;t know where to write her horrific letters. And I had some money and was gonna get a lot more with all the leave time I had built up, to help him, financing school.<br />
                            That meant I would have to wait to go back to Korea, a spell. <br />
                            It was hard to write my love what had happened to me, but she wrote back, &ldquo;I understand. I have a brother, too. I&rsquo;ll wait for you, forever.&rdquo;<br />
                            She then wrote me about her brother&rsquo;s problem. She had only talked about him as if he was in South Korea. But now she admitted in the letter her brother was still trapped in a probable prison in North Korea. She had made it out by making love with the guards for two long weeks at age fourteen, learning routes around the litters of mines, stole North Korean Uniforms for her and her brother and made her way through DMZ waving white flags, but her brother had been caught in the defection.<br />
                            I kept thinking. Maybe those young kids I scared away were really trying to defect. They didn&rsquo;t even have rifles, but why those long knives. Maybe I&rsquo;m not such a big hero after all. I never told my love about that night. I don&rsquo;t know why I didn&rsquo;t write back about those young kids. Maybe I was too embarrassed. I wish now I had.<br />
                            But to this day my brother&rsquo;s words still haunt me. &rdquo;You separate yourself from love, you live in shadows the rest of your life.&rdquo;<br />
                            &ldquo;Yeah, but there are still things you can do with love, like writing her story and composing her songs and now, like carrying on for your brother as a writer. And there are loves who you are less in communion with, but you still love. There are many different types of love. We are love beings, basically, despite the distractions and the misdirection this planet gives us.<br />
                            A year later my brother hiked the Sierra Trail for three weeks. He was found in a basket on a pulley above a ravine, death unknown, August 16 1967. My love, Kim, Kyung Suk, nick name Sunny, the same week, was killed trying to bring her brother back from North Korea. I guess my letter about my brother, spurred her to try. Her brother did make it, wounded, and wrote to me what had happened. We shared letters for a few years and even a random letter now and then twenty years later and made a date to reflect on theirs and our lives and to meet in 2007, in Yosu, Korea, August 16th, the day our siblings had died, forty years later. <br />
                            I know this is crazy but I have some strange memories of, not sure, maybe past lives. Maybe when you are born you pick up energies left behind of other lives and those memories affect your present life. We come here randomly, surely it is not too hard to believe when we arrive we pick up past lives energies still unresolved. And we either willingly or accidentally pick them up and try and resolve them. That is certainly a lot better of a probability than to insinuate we actually lived those lives. <br />
                            The fact that all the so called reincarnations are in the past, no one remembers future reincarnations, and time should have no preference, Isn&rsquo;t that weird?<br />
                            I think it is likely we just pick unresolved energies from other lives at birth. And the fact so many people have reincarnation memories of famous people, their energies being more prominent, could be the reason they pick up those energies in a higher proportion to non-famous people.<br />
                            I remember being a retarded child, looking out a fence hour after hour and in the back yard a peach tree.<br />
                            Oddly I found the house six blocks away from where I live in Hawaii. Maybe that is why I seemed to be retarded when I was young.<br />
                            When I was bicycling through Europe, I took a detour out of Paris for no reason I know, and three hours later found a balcony where I remember jumping over and killing myself as a soldier. I believe it was in the first world war. The thing I remember the most, is the horrible devastating feeling I felt after death. Like I had blown it so bad, there was no hope of recovering.<br />
                            It never crossed my mind to kill myself after the deaths of my two love ones. In retrospect it is amazing with my mind so muddled up, it didn&rsquo;t even occur to me, to do suicide. Maybe it was the memory of being that solder or because of all the trouble my mother and father and gone through keeping me alive, and yes, even Dr. Cherry, who use to come to our house for Christmas and died of a heart attack when I was nine. I hope they are proud of me, today, and glad they worked so hard to keep me alive.<br />
                            I don&rsquo;t know where to go from here. Memoirs do start to make me understand my life and motivations better, but still, they suck.<br />
                            But like my brother said. &ldquo;We translate our emotional drives into rationalizations that we use as skyhooks to keep us going&rdquo;. So March 1st, I&rsquo;ll continue with the memoirs that affect my writings. I don&rsquo;t know why it is, but writing this kind of stuff, I feel I have love for everybody here on this planet. Strange. But hell, it is the way I feel. Of course when people do something insanely stupid to my consciousness, I forget the love I felt for them. Maybe it is an earth situation, Consciousness here distorts things so much.<br />
                            Well by March 1, I should know if I have an agent for the Saga of the Mighty Valentine Cosmos. Wish me luck. <br />
